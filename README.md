# Vanilla-JS-Memory-Game
A little click and show picture matching game using Vanilla JS, HTML, CSS, bootstrap, JQuery

A simple traditional memory game where a bunch of cards are present in hidden format.
The user has to click a single card and a picture pops up. Then they have to perform hit and trail for 
another card. If the picture on this new card matches up with the previous then the score increases. If 
it doesn't, both the cards return back to being hidden. 

#Features
1. SFX options (only for PC Version later to be added to mobile)
2. Music on off options
3. Score checking
4. Error checking
5. Status on the basis of errors and matchings
6. 3 levels and the number of card increases along with the increase in level (Spring, Autumn, Winter)

#Issues
1. SFX button work only on PC
2. No use of modules therefore at level 3 the LOC just gets massive due to card object length 
3. Difficulty in managing grids for level 3 (mobile version)
